## The Last Ronin
Final Video Game Project 

### General Plot
This video game follows The Lone Ronin and his journey of avenging the village he has failed to protect, as the invading alien species, known as the Oni, 
have infiltrated and taken over the planet, slaughtering and obliterating all humans in attempt to please their leader, who has come to be known only as The Blind Hunter.

### Characters
The Lone Ronin - The character the user plays as. Skilled with a plethora of weaponry, ranging from melee to ranged, they are able to utilize whatever resource they can get their hands on.

Shadelings - The average Oni type, they make up the vast majority of the Oni species. They deal and take an average amount of damage
Bolters - The fastest of the enemy types. For what they lack in durability, they make up for in blitzing the player with their unmatched speed. Less amount of hits to take down, but harder to hit.
Banebeast - The biggest and strongest enemy type of the horde. Their brute strength is something the player should avoid at all cost, as the game will end before the player knows it if they get within reach of one. They take the most hits to kill, as well as do the most damage.

The Blind Hunter - The leader of the Oni, very little is known about them other than the fact that they use their ears to hunt, rather than their eyes. Although it may not see, it more than makes up for it in the hearing department, and is the leader of the Oni for a reason. 

### Gameplay
The player plays the game from a first-person perspective. Upon loading the game, the player will be shown the start screen, which gives them the option to either jump right into the game or look at the options, which will allow certain aspects, such as seeing how to play and entering cheat codes, to be accessed (as of now, not yet fully implemented).
When the player presses play, they are loaded into the game, beginning in one of the corners of the maze, and can freely move around by using the arrow keys, as well as the space button to jump. Currently, the enemies spawn as well, ranging between the middle of the map and away from the player initially, although they don't yet move. 
This is currently the scope of the gameplay

### Sources
The Oni appearances were found on the Unity asset store, as well as the animations that go with them. 
The player animations are being personally created, which is why they aren't currently done.
Also, the first-person view point was something that Unity has as a standard asset, which is what we used in order to help simplify the process.

Overall this is a simple game that conceptually mimics aspects of DOOM, and is designed to be a fun, 10-15 minute playthrough that players can enjoy for free.
